## Hierarchical Clustering

**1**   firstly identify the which two cluser are near each other for mature distance there are few mathed 
        1 Euclidean distance measure 
        2 Squared Euclidean distance measure
        3 Manhattan distance measure 
        4 Cosine distance measure    

**2** secondly this process continue untile the cluster will be last.

## K-Means Clustering

**1**   in first step data is mixed categories so clusters can classified items into  different categories .

**2**   then select k value. k value select by using below to method
        1  Elbow Method.
        2  Silhouette Method.

**3**   now Initialize centroids.

**4**  process will continue untile 2 diffrent type of clusters create.

**Note:-**  K-means clustering uses the euclidean distance method to find out the distance between the points.

## However, there are some pros and cons of Clustering.
