**K-Nearest Neighbour** accuracy score of y_pred is **0.93**.

**kernels svm** accuracy score of y_pred is **0.93**.

**LogisticRegression** accuracy score of y_pred is **0.89**.

**Gaussian distribution** accuracy score of y_pred is **0.90**.

**Random Forest Classification** accuracy score of y_pred is **0.91**.

**Support vector machine (SVM)** accuracy score of y_pred is **0.93**.

Base on the different classification mostly accuracy score is above .90 it's good contrast to LogisticRegression.

##
## **However, there are some pros and cons of classification.**
