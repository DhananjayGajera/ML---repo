# Multivariate regression

**1**   we have to select one feature that drives the multivariate regression. even This  feature  is highly responsible for the change in our dependent variable. 

**2**   Secondly, scale feature in a certain range (0-1 preferably) so that can analysing them gets a easy.

**3**   then, use formulated hypothesis (predicted value of the response variable (noted= h(x)) )
        Also, use loss function (calculate loss when the hypothesis predicts a wrong value)

**4**   after then Minimize the cost and loss function . Well One of the minimization algorithms that can be used is the gradient descent algorithm.

**5**   in last Test the hypothesis (Hypothesis is then tested with a test set to check its accuracy and correctness.)
