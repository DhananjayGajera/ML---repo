# Random Forest Regression
**1**   Boosting: Boosting is a technique that boosts the learning by grouping individual weak learners to form a single strong learner It is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model. Here, The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model.

**2**   Bootstrap Aggregation: Bootstrapping is a sampling technique in which we create subsets of observations from the original dataset. also referred to as Bagging. here size of the subsets used is the same as that of the original set. So,The size of subsets created for bagging may be less than the original set.
