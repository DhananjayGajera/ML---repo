# Decision-Tree-Regression

Using Decision Tree predict salary based on dataset(Position-level)
It is simple Decision Tree regressor model where data is non-continuous.(non-linear)

How dicision tree work for regrassion:

1   Make some splits on the dataset based on information entropy(basically dividing the points into some groups).Here,algorithm can decides the optimal number of splits and then splits the dataset accordingly them.

2   Algorithm will take the average value of each group and based on that values it will build the decision tree for this dataset.
